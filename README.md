# DA-project-railway
First project of the Design of Algorithms unit course
This project's main focus were max-flow algorithms

## Objectives
Create an analysis tool to support a management team of a railway network. This tool shall aid in three main concerns:
- **Basic Service Metrics** - Give simple information about the railway, for example, how many trains can simultaneously travel between two stations; how many trains can arrive in a station at the same time;
- **Operation Cost Optimization** - There are two types of trains with different costs of service per segment. Standard trains cost 2€ per segment and Alfa trains cost 4€ per segment. With that information i mind calculate the maximum amount of trains that can simultaneously travel between two specific stations with minimum cost for the company;
- **Reliability and Sensitivity to Line Failures** - Give useful insight about the segments whose failure would cause the highest damage to the overall railway grid.
